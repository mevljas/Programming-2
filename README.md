# Programming 2
Faculty subject Programming 2.
## Content (Syllabus outline)
Basic programming skills  
1. using programming languages to solve practical
problems;
2. presentation of good practices and pitfalls of
programming;
3. useful programming "recipes".
The building blocks of programming languages  
1. data types, variables and constants;
2. expressions, operators, structured code;
3. pointers, memory allocation and arrays;
4. work with files;
Object-oriented programming  
1. variables, methods, members, access modifiers;
2. classes, objects, inheritance, overriding;
3. abstract classes, interfaces;
4. event-driven programming;
5. comments and documentation.
### Objectives
The main goal of the course is to present the basic
principles of imperative programming with emphasis on
the procedural and object-oriented languages. In
addition to concepts related to specific programming
constructs (function, method, variable, operator,
memory, pointers, object, class, inheritance, ...)
students will learn the general programming concepts
such as portability, compiler, virtual machine , testing,
debugging, ... Each student that will conduct this course
should be able to independently solve semi complex
programming problems.
### Competences
Developing skills in critical, analytical and synthetic
thinking.  
The ability to understand and solve professional
challenges in computer and information science.  
The ability to apply acquired knowledge in independent
work for solving technical and scientific problems in
computer and information science; the ability to
upgrade acquired knowledge.  
Basic skills in computer and information science, which
includes basic theoretical skills, practical knowledge and
skills essential for the field of computer and information
science;  
Basic skills in computer and information science,
allowing the continuation of studies in the second study
cycle.
## Intended learning outcomes
### Knowledge and understanding:
Basic building blocks of programming languages data 
type, variable, constant expression, operator, function,
pointer, memory, arrays, files and object-oriented
programming (object, class, member, method,
inheritance, encapsulation, replacement, overlay,
interfaces). Understanding the importance of general
programming concepts, such as portability, compiler,
virtual machine, testing, debugging.
### Application
Students will gain the basic computer skills and the
ability to independently solve practical problems, which
is a skill that is extremely useful not only in large
numbers of courses with which the student encounters
during the study, but also in practice. A good knowledge
of the most commonly used languages of modern
industry allows relatively easy transition to other
languages.
### Reflection
Knowledge of basic programming languages helps in
understanding how the computer works. Modern
programming languages are a powerful tool for solving
industrial problems, and writing business applications.
### Transferable skills
Good knowledge of programming skills are very
important for understanding how the computer system
works.
